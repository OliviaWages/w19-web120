    <p>Hello and welcome to my website!</p>

    <p>My name is Olivia. I am currently a web design student at Seattle Central and am very excited to learn all I can! When I'm not learning to code I enjoy going to concerts, crafting, napping, and picnicing with friends. I am a self-professed cat lady and am trying to leash train my two cats so I can take them on picnics someday.</p>

    <p>If you have any tips, tricks, or constructive critcism pertaining to web design or leash training cats I'd love to hear from you!</p>
